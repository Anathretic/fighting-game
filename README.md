# Fighting Game

## About

I created this project as part of my university coursework to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming in JavaScript. Working on this simple 2D two-player fighting game helped me approach problems more abstractly and apply OOP principles in practice. I might expand it in the future with additional features like multiple levels, characters, and animations. For now, however, I'm focusing on other projects.
